// function init(options) {
//     {socket, tuid, ruid} = options
// }

// when a pitch is detected, if it matches one of the
// entries in the command map say (437-443 -> forward), 
// send off the command to the server
// so i need a command map. is that passed to this module
// or is it defined here? i think it should be defined here
// because it's not like that main code is changing any time
// soon. for right now, it's not a parametric thing
// it will be later
